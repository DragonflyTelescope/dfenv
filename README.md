Create the `dfenv` conda environment with
```bash
conda env create --file dfenv.yaml --name dfenv
```

URL to latest release can also be directly passed to conda without downloading, i.e.
```bash
conda env create --file https://github.com/DragonflyTelescope/dfenv/releases/latest/download/dfenv.yaml --name dfenv
```
